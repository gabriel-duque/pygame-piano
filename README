Introduction:
-------------

The goal of this project is to emulate a one-octave piano keyboard with our
computer keyboard.

We will also display the keyboard on screen and show pressed keys while the
user is playing.

In order to do that, we capture user keypresses and play notes using
`pygame.mdi` and update our display using `pygame.display`.

Setup:
------

To be able to use this project one must have a working MIDI playing
configuration.

On archlinux, this can be achieved by completing the following steps:

`pygame.midi` uses TiMidity++ as a backend to play MIDI notes on Linux so we
have to install and configure TiMidity++.

Install TiMidity++:

    # pacman -S timidity++

For TiMidity++ to work, you need to install a sound font as well to render
MIDI notes.

In this example we will install a well known sound font called Fluidr3:

    # pacman -S soundfont-fluid

To be able to acces TiMidity++ as a normal user you will have to add your
user to the audio group:

    # gpasswd -a <user> audio

For this to be taken into account, log out and log back in.

The final step before launching TiMidity++ is telling it to use the soundfont
we just installed. In order to do this add it to TiMidity++'s configuration
file.

    # echo 'soundfont /usr/share/soundfonts/FluidR3_GM.sf2' >> /etc/timidity++/timidity.cfg

If you installed another sound font you should obviously change the path
written in the configuration file so it matches the path to your sound font.

Once this is done, you can either start/enable the timidity.service `systemd`
service of launch TiMidity++ as a user.

If you want to launch it as a one-shot test you can start TiMidity++ like this:

    $ timidity -iA

For a more permanent/no-action setup, create a user `systemd` service by
creating a file called `timidity.service` with the following contents in
`~/.config/systemd/user/`:

    [Unit]
    Description=TiMidity++ Daemon
    After=sound.target
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/timidity -iA -Os
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target

Once, that is done, you can finish TiMidity++'s setup by using:

    $ systemctl --user enable --now timidity.service

Finally, install `pygame` from the `requirements.txt` file:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You might have to have superuser permissions to run the previous command.

Usage:
------

Usage: music.py [MIDI_DEVICE]

If you specify a MIDI device on the command-line, it will be used as the MIDI
output device port to send our lovely music to.

If not, a list of MIDI device ports as well as informartion about each one of
them will de given and the user will be prompted for a choice.

Default mapping:
----------------

The defaut mapping is set for a qwerty keymap. Annotations have be left for
azerty keymaps users in the source code and it should be relatively easy to
setup another keymap if needed.
